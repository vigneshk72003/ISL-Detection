Indian sign language is helpful for people who are deaf, dumb, or unable to interact with others. As a result, they can communicate through hand sign language.The Mediapipe Holistic model and the LSTM model carry out the entire detection process. Here, I've only included four signs. They are listed in the following order:Thank you,Thumbs up ,Thumbs down, and Hello. For every action, there are 30 folders in the dataset that I created on my own, and each folder has 30 frames. 3600 total frames. With this, I was able to attain 83% accuracy for my model.
